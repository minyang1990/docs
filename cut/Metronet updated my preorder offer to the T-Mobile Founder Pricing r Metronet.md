Metronet updated my preorder offer to the T-Mobile Founder Pricing
==================================================================

So I called the Metronet **Customer Care:** 877-407-3224 and was on hold for about an hour (so it does take a bit), and told the rep I wanted to cancel my preorder to swap to the T-Mobile pricing, was told no prob, and placed on a maybe 3-5 min hold. I was put on the line with a "Loyalty Department" rep, and she was able to swap my preorder over to the T-Mobile Founder Pricing. I've noticed many people posting about having to cancel to swap. I figured I'd suggest asking to be connected to the "loyalty" team to speed things up.

Personally, I didn't cancel/swap, but rather got the loyalty dept about six weeks ago or so and asked if I could get the new pricing for my current 500/500 and she said sure, it's $60/month. and my bill new bill was just getting ready to come out and she gave me credit for that bill which ended up being $63 and some change. Fast forward to the new bill that just came out and it's freaking $35. And I have NO clue why it's so low

I just tried the same, but all I got was off the current install calendar (sometime "this Fall"). I will just suffer with Xfinity until T-Mobile lets me know when they are going to set things up.

Yeah I'm also paying 70 for 1 gig now but if they are getting 2gig for 70 we should still be paying less..
