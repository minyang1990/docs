TracFone unlocking policy updated
=================================

**\[April 9 Update\]**

**The device (1) automatically unlocked.**

**\==========================================**

**\[Updated\]**

The agents from Straight Talk, Total Wireless, and TracFone all said that devices activated before April 1st should follow the old unlocking policy. In my case, the Straight Talk agents confirmed that my device should be unlocked tomorrow. I’ll keep this information updated as needed.

**\==========================================**

**\[Original\]**

Today was supposed to be the unlocking date for one of my devices, which was activated on February 8th. Unfortunately, it looks like TracFone's unlocking policy was updated as of April 1st. According to the new policy, a device will now be unlocked 60 days after paid activation and 60 days of paid active service.

I have two devices:

(1) Galaxy A16 5G purchased on February 8th (Straight Talk)  
(2) Galaxy A16 5G purchased on March 8th (Straight Talk)

For device (1), I was expecting it to be unlocked today, but it wasn't. I contacted customer service and received confirmation that I need to pay for another month of service in order to unlock it. Now, the expected unlocking date for device (1) is May 8th. As we know, texting UNLOCK to 611611 no longer works, but it seems like customer service is still able to check your unlocking date.

Based on what I can tell, even though the device was activated before April 1st, the new unlocking policy still applies, meaning the April 1st policy affects all devices regardless of activation date.

\------------------------------------------------------------

**\[Additional\]**  
It looks like Verizon is continuing to migrate the TracFone system into their own. The Galaxy A16 purchased in February shows the carrier name as "HOME", which is a typical indicator for all TracFone brands. However, the other A16 purchased in March now shows "Verizon" as the carrier name.

Do Straight Talk phones follow the TracFone unlock policy?

The TracFone policy hasn't changed that I see. If you just want the phone, a 90-day TracFone plan is inexpensive.

All TracFone brands, including Straight Talk, have the same policy.

Yes, Straight Talk follows TracFone's unlocking policy and is now considered one of Verizon Value brands. I signed up with Straight Talk because there was a free device promotion going on at Walmart.

Well, if you activated the phone before April 1, and Tracfone is declining to unlock it according to their updated policy as of April 1, file an FCC complaint. It doesn't matter what policy Tracfone is showing now, it matters what policy they publicly displayed at the date of activation. This should be a no-brainer, and Tracfone will reach out to you to complete the unlock. (Well, it would absolutely be a no-brainer before the current administration, at least.)

I see your update here but just FYI, it's not all cut and dry. Some people have had their phones still automatically unlock as scheduled, others didn't and were told they have to have 60 paid days.

What happens if you skip a month or more, do you still get credit for your first month or owe 2 new 60 days?

Applies to total wireless too?

Verizon Value Brands:  
Verizon Prepaid, Visible, TracFone, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink, and Walmart Family Mobile

• [4d ago](/r/NoContract/comments/1juojj6/comment/mm3z5ze/) • Edited 4d ago

For device (1), I paid for service on February 8th, and it expired after the March cycle. I reactivated it today (April 8th). Customer service confirmed that I just need one more month of service to unlock it. Let's see if that's true in May...

As of now, it looks like I am still within the first 30-day cycle (Customer service confirmed that I am on 31st active service now). I don't remember the exact expiration policy for TracFone brands, but I think it used to be 60 days after the service expiration. So I am assuming that if the device stays expired for over 60 days, you might have to start from scratch.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Edit: Based on the unlocking policy website, the brands include Straight Talk, Net10, Clearway, Total Wireless, TracFone, Simple Mobile, SafeLink, and Walmart Family Mobile.

Verizon now refers to them as "Verizon Value Brands," which include: Total Wireless, Visible, Straight Talk, TracFone, Simple Mobile, SafeLink, Walmart Family Mobile, and Verizon Prepaid. Therefore, these brands will likely follow the same unlocking policy at some point.

Additionally, it’s unclear whether excluded brands like GoSmart Mobile and Page Plus follow the same policy.

Well I guess it's a good thing I decided to pay for a second month for my 16e anyway. I had a feeling that I was going to have to. Thanks for the update.

No but I got $25 off for buying the 16e (the offer was to get $25 credits for 12 months starting in the second month) so it was like $42 instead of $65. It goes down to $38 if I set it to autopay and keep it.

The conclusion seems to be that cases activated before April 1 should follow the previous policy. Please keep the updates coming!

I think , it does require an active service for the device now , irrespective , they were activated before or after 4/1/25. Better to do recharge for 2nd month , then fighting with them to flag the account for future. See this chat with straight talk customer service today

The homepage was updated today, but the effective date is listed as April 1st. I don't understand why it took them 8 days to inform users and still display it as April 1st.

Then legally the date they updated the public facing unlocking policy is the date that counts. The FCC requirement is clear that the 'public facing' policy is what counts, and they can be fined heavily for not following their public facing policy.

Recently I found out that my Motorola edge unlocked itself which I find real cool. I only found out by trying to unlock it manually only to found out minutes later did so automatically. I was going to use the phone with another SIM but the great hotspot quality and 300gb a month of data a month , Verizon hotspot capabilities with the Motorola edge are real good

Yeah that’s illegal to have prior purchases use a new T&C, without consent or notice. But who’s going to hold them accountable right now.

Not the FCC.

    No Unlocking Services Posts
    ---------------------------
    

Most of these unlocking services are scams and those that aren't are doing shady things to get the devices unlocked. Follow your carrier's unlocking policy or don't buy the device.

    Don't Post Anything Illegal
    ---------------------------
    

This should go without saying but don't post or link to any illegal content, including cracked apps.

    Use of tools that randomize your posts, like Redact, will result in a permanent ban
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

Reddit is a community for sharing information. If you don't wish to contribute then don't. Posts mass edited by these tools flood the mod queue and if we see it happen we will mass delete every post and comment you've ever made and you will then be permanently banned.
