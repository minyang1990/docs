you can do the alternative solution on this post here. worked for me [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/s/5jDUPYl9uU](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/s/5jDUPYl9uU)

edit: it stopped working for me! i suppose its time for me to part ways with chrome. it was fun while it lasted.

This worked:

1.  Enter chrome://flags in chrome’s URL input
    
2.  Search for ‘Allow legacy extension manifest versions’
    
3.  Enable it and relaunch browser
    
4.  Download the latest zip file of uBlock version from github: [https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases)
    
5.  Under Assets, download the chromium zip and extract it
    
6.  Open the extension page in chrome, click the Load Unpacked button on top left side load (enable Developer Mode in the top right if it doesn't appear), then select the extracted folder.

Thanks, it worked!

Though this seems ominous:

> This should only be used for maintaining legacy extensions **and will be removed in the future.**

I should probably just move to Firefox.

Meh, a little too late, I've switched to Firefox and called it a day. Google will do more of these shenanigans in the future, so might as well leave chrome behind.

Just the fact that Chrome is willing to do that, forcefully disable extensions it doesn't like, it a massive red flag for potentially worse shenanigans in the future.

It uses google as it's main search engine, but that's about it.

You can still install uBO on it just fine.

Whoosh much? The point is chrome is going ham with anti ad block policies. I've used chrome for about 10 years until yesterday.

The point is I switched because Google can't stop trying to shove ads down our throats.

Im stating the fact that I've changed due to their policies.

Before this post ( when it comes to chrome) the latest comments I made about it was 4 months ago when I stated that when they do make it impossible for me to use ad blockers, I'll switch.

Soooo, I don't know what your point is here. Maybe you should have picked someone else who actually does that all the time?

Sorry, even though you did nothing wrong I ended up taking it out on you because I was sick of seeing so many obnoxious comments like "lol you guys still on chrome?" Or "ignore advice, just use x" under post with people giving genuine advice for people that don't want or care to switch. Just to reiterate yes, I'm sorry.

Well, if you put it like that, I'm sorry for talking out of line.

But use whatever you see fit. For me ads are out of the question as to watch some streaming services there is so many ads that it's just a bad experience all together.

Youtube is the one I use the least, but google is doing this because of youtube, as their business model is all about the ads.

I get it, there is so many people out there that just try and shove whatever they believe is the best so you should too. Firefox is simply the one I used before Chrome, so I went back to it. I also use Brave on my phone for convenience. So I'm sorry if I felt like one the browser groupies to you.

my only reason for not using firefox mainly instead of chrome is because how much slower it is than chrome in many areas. like the roblox website, it either takes 5 minutes to fully load or just doesnt load at all. i dont know how to fix it, ive tried clearing cache, removing cookies, etc etc.

I just swapped over to firefox and it was slow for me as well, but i tried this and it worked for me.

1). Load firefox

2). Click settings (should be top right)

3). Then click on "Privacy & Security"

4). Scroll down till you see "Enable DNS over HTTPS using:"

5). Mine was set on "Off" but then i turned it to "Increased Protection" and provider is Cloudfare.

After doing this, everything is loading faster, even youtube. However, I believe that Google is actively slowing down youtube if you are not using Chrome.

\*sigh\*

Firefox is a browser that is owned and operated my Mozilla. Why everybody is recommending it is because its backend doesn't run on Chromium (the same backend that chrome, edge, brave, etc etc use). Yes, It offers Chrome as its default \*browser\* - but you can switch to DuckDuckGo.

So you're not subjected to Google

There are some, but they are more restricted than in UBO.

For one, I couldn't find how to block JS/CSS files on site, only pick and block specific elements on the page.

It blocks ads differently. Some still go through Lite, such as youtube ads.

The problem with firefox is that it is horrible with youtube, chrome buffers about 10 times less on the same internet and same video with the same quality.

Not having ads is nice, but the viewing experience always becomes so much worse with firefox.

That only happens if chrome detects an adblocker, and when it does it gives you a little popup telling you your experience might be worse.

Firefox is just complete garbage when it comes to video streaming.

Yeah, sure it is, but their neverending need for ever increasing profit drives them to throw more and more ads while having the audacity to charge us for subscriptions that still throw ads at us. An ad-based service would be fine but not like this. Their greed is the problem. Full stop.

I found this in another Reddit post.

\- Go to chrome://flags/

\- Search for "Allow legacy extension manifest versions"

\- Enable it

\- Reinstall Ublock Origin from GitHub with version 1.65.

That should fix it for now.

I did your steps. and i installed ublock origin by downloading 1.65 with developer mode on. Load unpacked. and select the root map which i rename to "ublock". Chrome says Extension loaded. however ublock remains on 1.64.. and can't enable. any guess?  
Oh nvm it shows up as an additional extension next to 1.64. Works! THANKS!

There's a way to bring back Ublock Origin.

1.  Go to your Registry Editor
    
2.  Type down this path on top there Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Google
    
3.  If Google folder doesn't exist, create it.
    
4.  Create a Chrome folder inside the Google folder.
    
5.  Then right click the Chrome folder to create a new DWORD (32 bit)
    
6.  Name that to ExtensionManifestV2Availability
    
7.  Double click it and edit the value data from 0 to 2.
    
8.  Close the registry editor and then restart your Chrome. You should be able to find the Ublock Origin in the extension store there and reinstall it.

I generally don’t recommend installing Firefox because it’s not anymore privacy friendly than chrome. They sold out. If people want Firefox, download hardened versions. Librewolf and Waterfox are the first to come to mind.

I use Brave because these hardened versions have some sort of memory leak and become incredibly slow after using for awhile. Just harden brave a bit more and you’re good to go!

Technically all they did was force disable it on all users, but there was nothing stopping anyone from re-enabling it lol.

This time however, they literally locked the toggle bar, you can't even click to re-enable even if you wanted to.

You can still download uBlock Origin Lite though, because whoever is responsible for this at Google is terrible at their job (or pretends to be to make life easier for us). It'll eventually get removed too ofc, but it's still hilarious.

Anyway, guess I'm gonna transition to Firefox as well now.

This was announced more than 2 years ago. And it's not just unlock, Chrome switched to a new extension API that is more secure and it affected a lot of extensions. The security reasons actually make sense if you look at them logically.

All you care about is an ad blocker, use Ublock Origin Lite. It works pretty much just as well as the original. It just doesn't allow custom filters.

There seem to be a few working methods (at least for now), but the one below is the best IMO because it re-enables the original extension you had installed (that got disabled by Google) and you can still recover/use your original Custom Filters:

chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m137                     \[Enabled\]

**Then restart Chrome and you can set:**

chrome://flags/#extension-manifest-v2-deprecation-warning         \[Disabled\]
chrome://flags/#extension-manifest-v2-deprecation-disabled        \[Disabled\]
chrome://flags/#extension-manifest-v2-deprecation-unsupported     \[Disabled\]
chrome://flags/#allow-legacy-mv2-extensions                       \[Enabled\]

DuckDuckGo and Brave are both Chromium-based browsers, so uBlock Origin will be dead in them as well the next time they update their base code. The only major browsers NOT affected by this are Firefox and Safari.

Guys I got a shit load of accounts and stuff on chrome that it is almost impossible for me to change browsers at this point. Chrome is BS;

But I found this video - and it works and it is great [https://youtu.be/PIqO2rIKTlc?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/PIqO2rIKTlc?feature=shared)

To summarize

1.  enable Allow legacy extension manifest versions in chrome://flags
    
2.  Download and extract the latest release of uBlock origin from github - [https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases)
    
3.  Go to chrome://extensions turn on Developer Mode and click on "load unpacked" and select the uBlock folder named "uBlock0.chromium" and then just clear the errors and you're good to go :D

That's not the same at all, it's very inferior to UBlock Origin because of manifest v3.

The technical reason being Google completely crippled ad blockers in a lot of ways in manifest v3 which makes it impossible for ad blockers to be anywhere near as effective then manifest v2 ad blockers. To the point that they might have to make multiple versions of the same ad blocker that you have to install in order to work around some of the horrible limitations in v3.

Go look up manifest V3 if you are that curious about it. And the changes from V2. It's way too many to list here. Lite needs to remain compliant with V3, making it MUCH less effective.

It already hasn't worked for me on some youtube videos. Which is what prompted me to switch to firefox.

Because without an ad blocker (ublock is just one of the many) you'll get all those nasty ads on youtube and streaming websites.

The last manifest version of Chrome made it purposely impossible to skip ads (for profit reason, google owns youtube).

Firefox is not affected by this change, since it's not Chromium based.

While true, the only workaround is changing browser and that probably would be the solution, if we were the majority of chrome user base… well, we can still do ourself a favour whenever we feel like it’s enough

Just switch to Firefox or a browser that’s based on Firefox (for me it’s Zen), it’s not a perfect solution but it’s way better overall than chrome and uBlock works!

You can try switching to brave browser but I recently got a sneak peak of youtube’s next move against them which is to not let you sign in to YouTube when using it. It works fine for now though.
