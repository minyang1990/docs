Need to view everything as 'General Items'
==========================================

Has Windows 11 yet allowed us to always view files as "General Items" (and never view as "Pictures" or "Music" or anything else)?

Having to change the view again and again just because there might be a picture or sound file added to a directory is slowing me way down. And the "Also apply this template to all subfolders" checkbox does NOT work.

Thanks!

Hi K.E.R., I am Paulo and I'd like to help.  
  
It's possible that Automatic Folder Type Discovery is still enabled. This means that Windows will automatically detect the contents of the folder and change it to proper template.  
  
If you prefer only General items for all, you may check option three from this link to specify all folders as General items. This will also disable automatic folder type discovery.

That's why this tool exists:

[https://lesferch.github.io/WinSetView/](https://lesferch.github.io/WinSetView/ "lesferch.github.io")

You can use it to set all folder types to have the same view and, optionally, set all folders to be type Generic (aka General items) which will completely disable automatic folder type discovery. Enable the "Advanced" interface to see that option.

Yes, "Also apply this template to all subfolders" is broken in Windows 11. I've wasted a lot of hours of my life trying to get the word out on that one and, more importantly, get Microsoft to fix it. So far, nada. For NTFS Local Disks, I made a workaround:

[https://lesferch.github.io/SetFolderType/](https://lesferch.github.io/SetFolderType/ "lesferch.github.io")

Or, you can revert to the Windows 10 Explorer and get full functionality back. See this link for more info:

[https://lesferch.github.io/OldExplorer/](https://lesferch.github.io/OldExplorer/ "lesferch.github.io")

I don't work for Microsoft. I'm just another user and a developer of some free Windows tools.

In reply to Paulo GM's post on November 21, 2023 

Thank you Paulo!

I almost tried that fix but frankly messed some things up scripting a batch file not long ago, so wanted to work myself up first Then I found another thread here that recommended a tool called WinSetView. I tried that tool first as the thread didn't note any problems, and it seems to have cleared everything up for now. I might still try the elevenforum fix if this doesn't hold, even if it's just to get past my fear. ;-)

Cheers!
